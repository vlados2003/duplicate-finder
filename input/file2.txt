On Sunday Tessa’s brother and Tessa were in their grandmother’s cottage. Their parents were not with them, they were at work. It was foggy and windy on Sunday and the children were in the cottage together with their grandmother and her little dog. The dog was not happy. It likes to run but it can’t run in the cottage.
